abstract: Monitoring and self-assessment of tracking algorithms are essential in modern automated driving systems. However, the further use of this self-assessment information is another growing and not thoroughly studied area of research. One option is to adapt the parameters configured in the tracking algorithm online to obtain better and more robust tracking results directly. The paper proposes a novel overall concept and framework for adaptive Kalman filtering using subjective logic. Based on a self-assessment method, we present multiple variants of adaptive strategies to adapt the noise assumptions online for Kalman filtering. This paper focuses mainly on adaptation procedures for multi-sensor Kalman filters. The proposed method is evaluated in various experiments and compared with state-of-the-art adaptive Kalman filters.
