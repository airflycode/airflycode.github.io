        As a Ph.D. researcher at the **Institute of Measurement, Control and Microtechnology** at **Ulm University**, my work focuses on developing robust sensor fusion techniques for autonomous driving systems. A central aspect of my research has been on **monitoring and self-assessment of tracking algorithms**, aiming to improve the reliability and robustness of multi-sensor fusion pipelines.

        During this time, I have authored and co-authored **nine first- or co-first-author publications**, along with several additional co-author contributions. These works have primarily been published at leading IEEE and ISIF conferences, including **IV**, **ITSC**, **FUSION**, and **MFI**.

        I have contributed to several collaborative research projects, with key roles in the [SecForCARs](https://www.forschung-it-sicherheit-kommunikationssysteme.de/projekte/sicherheit-fuer-vernetzte-autonome-fahrzeuge) and [EVENTS](https://www.events-project.eu/) projects, focusing on secure and reliable environment perception systems for intelligent vehicles.

        Beyond my core research, I am actively involved in student mentoring. I have supervised **three Bachelor's theses** and **five Master's theses**, primarily in the areas of sensor fusion, environment perception, and autonomous driving. In addition, I have mentored **seven working and research students**.

        I have also gained substantial teaching experience, serving as an exercise supervisor in *Digital Control Systems* and in practical courses such as *Measurement and Automation Technology* and *Control Engineering*. Earlier in my academic journey, I held several teaching assistant positions during my Master's and Bachelor's studies in both the **USA** and **Germany**.
