I had the pleasure of contributing to two inspiring workshops at the [IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium 2025 (IV2025)](https://2025.ieee-iv.org/), held in Romania. Both workshops addressed critical challenges in autonomous driving — from safety validation to managing uncertainty in perception and decision-making systems.

🛠️ **Invited Talk**  
**Workshop on Ensuring and Validating Safety for Automated Vehicles**  
📅 June 22 | 🗣️ *Thomas Griebel (Ulm University)*  
**Talk:** *"Toward a Unified Framework for Runtime Monitoring and Self-Assessment in Autonomous Driving Systems"*
